                <p>
                Hi, I'm Brooke! Welcome to my website! During my time as an interim Scrum Master, I discovered a profound interest in software
                development. This fascination led me to embark on a transformative journey to pursue a different career path.
                Through my studies at OSU, I have unearthed a genuine passion for programming, particularly in the realm of
                problem-solving. As I navigate the vast landscape of software development, I find myself strongly drawn to web
                and mobile app development. My focus is directed towards pursuing captivating opportunities in front-end development.
